# Multiply-divide-practice

This is a re-upload of a project I did back in March of 2024

### Overview
I built this project for my brother so he could practice his multiplication and division tables. After one finishes a practice set, the data is inserted into a database using MySQL so one could view the progress of the user.

### MySQL Download Instructions
This code requires the user to download the latest verison of MySQL. To do that, go here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

### Requirements
The "database+table creation_.py" file assumes there is another file known as "config.py" for when the user runs it to create their MySQL database. This file should include exclusivly the following:
```
host = 'localhost'
user = "root"
password = "<Your Password>"
```
